# Peer Tutoring Group Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the peer tutoring group, pledge to create a respectful and harassment-free environment for everyone. We commit to treating all members with empathy and fairness, regardless of their age, body size, visible or invisible disabilities, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, educational background, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are dedicated to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and supportive community that values collaboration, learning, and mutual respect.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviors we encourage include:**

* Demonstrating kindness, patience, and understanding towards peers and team members.  
* Respecting different perspectives, ideas, and learning styles.  
* Providing constructive feedback in a considerate manner.  
* Acknowledging and learning from mistakes, and taking responsibility for them.  
* Working collaboratively to ensure the group achieves its shared goals.  

**Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:**

* Any form of harassment, bullying, or exclusionary behavior.  
* Discriminatory or offensive comments, jokes, or language.  
* Sharing private information, including academic or personal data, without explicit permission.  
* Disruptive or uncooperative behavior that hinders group progress.  
* Actions that discourage participation, such as belittling contributions or ideas.  

## Responsibilities of Group Leaders  

Group leaders are responsible for maintaining a positive and inclusive learning environment. They will:

* Clearly communicate expectations and enforce the Code of Conduct fairly and consistently.  
* Address any inappropriate behavior promptly and appropriately.  
* Provide support and resources to any member who reports violations.  

Leaders have the authority to moderate group activities, adjust contributions, and implement corrective measures to uphold the groupâ€™s values.  

## Scope  

This Code of Conduct applies within all group interactions, whether they occur in person, online, or during any project-related events. This includes interactions in study sessions, discussions, presentations, and any communication platforms used for the project.  

## Reporting Concerns  

If you experience or witness any unacceptable behavior, please report it to the group leaders or faculty supervisor responsible for the project. Reports will be handled promptly and with discretion to protect the privacy and security of all individuals involved.  

Contact details for reporting issues will be shared by group leaders.
